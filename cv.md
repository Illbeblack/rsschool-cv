### About me

I started my career as a professional trumpet player. I have performed like solo and orchestra musican. I have also been a music teacher for ten years, but health problems made me think about changing my live, profession and about a job that I would have enjoyed as much as playing the trumpet.

I became interested in learning Frontend Development. This profession interested me with its prospects, importance in the modern world, ability to create something, huge amount of public information and an incredible community.

I believe that my teaching experience and responsible approach to work will help me in learning and becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.
